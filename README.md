# specdraw.js
A javascript library for interactive visualization and client-side manipulation of NMR spectra. The package is still under developlment.

### Exmaples
To see the package in action, visit my [codepen](http://codepen.io/collection/ngYkmJ)
### Current functions:
* Redering of 1D spectra from JSON files, including PNG compressed spectra.
* Supports zooming, peak picking/deleting, integration.
* Styling of spectra using CSS.

### Roadmap:
* Complete 2D spectral rendering.
* Visualization of multiple spectra in the same SVG (using a sliding side panel to change between spectra)
* Linking events on multiple spectra drawn in different SVGs (for metabolomics application).
* Render "datasets" of spectra
* Interactivity with server-side using AJAX for baseline and phase correction.
